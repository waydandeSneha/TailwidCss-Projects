    <i>"Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do
      with ideas, the way we live, what is happening. It’s not just about clothes; it’s about the spirit of the time,
      the way people express who they are without saying a word. True fashion reflects the moment, captures the mood,
      and turns individuality into art." </i><b>– inspired by Coco Chanel</b>
